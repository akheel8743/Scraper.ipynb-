# Scraper.ipynb-
AI-Powered E-commerce Site Replication 🚀
This project was created as part of a challenge by Swastika Web Technology to replicate the structure and content of a small e-commerce website using only AI tools.

🔧 Project Overview
I chose the website Books to Scrape as a sample e-commerce site. It contains categories, product listings, images, and descriptions—ideal for demonstrating scraping and replication using AI.

📁 Deliverables
✅ books.csv – Cleaned scraped product data in CSV format

✅ books.json – Same data in JSON format

✅ index.html – AI-generated static mockup of the site

✅ styles.css – Styling for the mockup

✅ ecommerce_scraper.ipynb – Google Colab notebook with full scraping code

✅ screenshot.png – Preview of the generated HTML page

✅ Loom Video – Explanation of the workflow (see below)
